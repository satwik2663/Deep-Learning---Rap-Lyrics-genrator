# Deep-Learning - Rap-Lyrics-genrator

This model demonstrates the efficiency of a Long Short-Term Memory Language model along with the baseline model to generate unconstrained rap lyrics.  This model aims at creating similar in style yet unique lyrics. Additionally, the model defines  the line length of the lyrics by comparing the last word with the most rhymed word. The experiments show that automatically generated lyrics can correctly capture the patterns and styles of multiple lyricist and fit into certain scenarios. As evaluation method can be used to analyze system performance, we propose methods like Cosine similarity, Rhyme Density and bilingual evaluation understudy.  We provide a corpus of lyrics for 11 rap artists with 11,540 unique words and 20,007 lines of lyrics. We also suggest further work for understanding and improving this process and generating more novel lyrics
